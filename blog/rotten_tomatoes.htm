        <h2>Rotten Tomatoes</h2>
<p>The summer sun was up in the sky, tearing down layers of moisture over the graveled alleyway that bordered Kashi&#8217;s home. It was nearly time. He sat at the edge of a couch, clutching the metal bars with his soft, tiny fingers. He jammed his face against the bars, feeling the heat sinking into his soft tissue.</p>
<p>It was then that it happened. He heard the jingling of the bronze bells, three in all ! Kashi ran towards the opposite shelf, nearly colliding with a basket of clothes on his way. He hastily rummaged through the untidy mound of papers, toys and keys until he had found it.<br />
He ran out !</p>
<p>Seconds later, his bare feet hit the gravel. He bounded through the ocean of gravel and sand, skimming dirt.<br />
At 313 K of heat, the razor-sharp edges of gravel hurt the tender skin of the eight year old.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t care !</p>
<p>At the bend in the road, stood a lean man. He held a worn out rope in his weathered hands which he pulled frantically every second or two. The rope branched out into three, each branch ending up at the bottom of a bronze bell.</p>
<p>&#8221; Where are your slippers ? &#8221; He questioned Kashi, who had covered the remaining distance in less than four rings of his bells. He now leaned over the little boy, smiling at him ! Kashi stood besides the jagged edges of his cart, shifting his weight on his feet. On the wooden plate next to him, candies and creams had been painted in red, blue and white. Between the mystifying figures was the text &#8220; ICE CREAM &#8221;. &#8220; Wo to ghar pe hain &#8221;, Kashi smiled, showing off a gaping hole where a wobbly incisor had once been.</p>
<p>The lean man raised his brow, amused at the reply of his tiny friend. Kashi knew him as &#8216;Shyam&#8217;. The little boy offered him an old, rusty, two rupee coin! His fingers curled across the rim as he raised it up. Shyam winked as he dropped the coin into his pouch and handed the boy his candy. The boy would never know that his candy was worth well over twice the amount he had paid.</p>
<p>Kashi licked through the upper layers of cream and ran home while Shyam stood there watching him hop across the street. The blisters on his bare feet hurt. He pushed his cart away from the path the little boy had taken. The thin crust of rubber on the wheels hit the jagged end of a pebble.</p>
<p>Shyam pushed harder. Sweat trickled down his temple fusing into the tear drop that rolled beneath his eyes!</p>
<p>It had been a year!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>THE YEAR 2005</p>
<p>A lean man stood in a queue if the bank, his cart parked outside. An old fan creaked over his head. He mopped his face with a thin cotton cloth hanging around his neck. Thirty minutes later, he met the accountant with a wide grin. The deep stench of tobacco and his twisted, rickety teeth were probably not a welcome sign. The accountant nodded with a grim expression and did his favors.</p>
<p>For years, a fear had haunted him. While he worked, while he prayed, while he slept, there was but one thought in his mind.<br />
His daughter.</p>
<p>From the day her mother had given birth, things had changed for them. He wanted her to be happy. But, in his land, happiness was measured in hard curreny! But now, the misery had subsided. He had a fine groom for her daughter. One he had earned, sixty thousand a piece at his own pay cheque of a hundred rupees a day. He believed in god. One who loved all his children.</p>
<p>Shyam thanked him for his blessings and pushed his cart home.</p>
<p>2006 AGAIN !</p>
<p>Shyam looked at the pouch tied across his waist. The bulge was tiny. Weeks ago, a child had died of cheap candy. The news had hit the town and spread like fire. Life&#8217;s worth exceeded the blocks of sugar and milk he sold. He looked up at the sky. The clouds seemed to have tangled into a web.</p>
<p>He was thinking of the one who perched over the clouds, looking at the world below.<br />
The one who had betrayed him an year ago.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>BACK TO 2005 :<br />
The lean man reached home. He took off his slippers in the verandah. Beyond the door of his mud thatched house sat the idol of Lord Ganesha. His faith in his lord was deep, his offerings lavish by his means and his devotion unmatched. Shyam&#8217;s wife Sumegha took over her pouch and basket. She undid the things and smiled at her husband knowingly.</p>
<p>The money wasn&#8217;t there ! What was, were three plump tomatoes. She put them to boil and baked a stale loaf of bread. Dinner was ready !</p>
<p>Families are glad to be together. They might look in the face of a disaster and walk into it so long as they are together. Shyam and his wife sat next to each other, their children Ajay and Shrishti sat against the door on a mat, eating out of a banana leaf. Sumegha, disturbed by their tempo, poured the remainig puree into their leaf and held her son&#8217;s hand to feed him.</p>
<p>She was terrified.<br />
Ajay went cold. He hadn&#8217;t talked of his sickness since the past week. His temprature had shot ever since. He would spend the nights shivering in cold with a burning sensation piercing his abdomen. He would not bother his father with his mild jolt of sickness</p>
<p>The baarat would be at their doors in less than a week. They had barely saved the money for her dowry. The groom was a fine man. A technical assistant at the &#8216;factory&#8217; as Ajay had known it since his childhood. He wished to see his sister&#8217;s hands dyed in henna. A sister who had grown to be 23, who had given up her education for his sake. They could afford the fee for only one! She had stood firm over her decision.<br />
He was to study and become a &#8216;sahib&#8217; one day. &#8221; I will take your official car for a ride and tease my husband &#8220;, she&#8217;d say, impressing the officiality of his to be &#8216;sahib&#8217; brother.</p>
<p>Perhaps the poor have no right to dream, Ajay said to himself as Shyam pulled a bundle of fifty rupee notes into his pocket and took him off to the district hospital.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>PRESENT&#8230;</p>
<p>Shyam sat at the edge of a pond. Filth lined its boundary. A few animals bathed, splashing sand and water against the backdrop of the setting sun. He thought of the year that had passed.</p>
<p>That night he had taken his son to the narrow corridor huddled with hundreds of ailing men. These men were incapable of paying the fee that glamorous therapists and surgeons charged. The needed cure, so they turned to their government.</p>
<p>Shyam held his son&#8217;s hand, feeling his temprature rise. He waited. A man dressed in blue spat at the wall adjacent to him, turning it red. The air in the w space reeked with tincture and salt. An hour later, the same man who had painted a little segment of wall led them int o a little chamber. The doctor examined him.</br>
He peered into his throat, checked a few pulses and wrote his prescription. &#8220;Its nothing&#8221;, He said, adding &#8220;He&#8217;ll be fine as a horse in a day or two.&#8221; He then encircled an address and told Shyam to meet him there in two days.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a clinic.<br />
The doctor had ordered blood samples and a few other tests. &#8220;Just precautionary&#8221;, he had mentioned with a smile. 18 hours later, he had quoted the requirement of an operation. Ajay had lost a kidney. They had kept him on dialysis for the time.</p>
<p>The operation would not begin until he had paid the advance. Shyam ran home, only this time he had no time for tributes for his lord. He pulled a rickshaw and paid a visit to the bank. The operation needed five thousand advance, a third of the total cost.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>The tilak ceremony was due in two days. Ajay&#8217;s sister sat next to his bed.<br />
&#8221; Your husband&#8217;s gonna be an ass &#8220;, he winked at her !</p>
<p>Tears rolled down her eyes.<br />
Outside, the doctor spoke to the patients tone in a muted tone, &#8221; I&#8217;ll discharge him now. You need to shift him to a city, Delhi perhaps. He&#8217;ll be treated well there. &#8220;<br />
Shyam read the statement on his passbook as he walked out of the clinic.</p>
<p>BALANCE                 ***25,000.00</p>
<p>New Delhi, the capital of India. It is a city of fortunes, breathing prosperity. It glows in the night with a charm of its own. Ajay could never let his eyes stare into the galis and nukkads of Delhi. He shut them on his way, in a general compartment of a train which he had boarded the same day.</p>
<p>Two days later, the baarat stood at their doors. A pot-bellied lord Ganesha looked over the man who had just buried his son. An elderly man stood across him in royal fatigues. The &#8216;dulha&#8217; rode a white horse. But there was no henna on the dulhan&#8217;s palms. The melody of shehnai had stopped.<br />
Shyam had no tears to spare. He had failed to deliver a promise at the right time.</p>
<p>The baarat returned, abusing a man who couldn&#8217;t keep his words, singing praises of their worthy son who would find a bride as white as snow and bright as the sun.<br />
</p>
<p>A baarat which didn&#8217;t know the man had lost a son.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p>Shyam watched the sun set into the horizon. He counted his earnings, sixty-five in all. A few things had changed over the years. There were no tomatoes in his basket. Neither were potatoes or spinach or rice !! They would dine with a little salt and water.</p>
<p>A drop of water pounded the perspiring man. The monsoon had arrived.<br />
The season for candies and ice creams was over !</p>
