        <h2>Unfinished</h2>
<p>A shrill humming noise pierced the cold air that engulfed the space within the four walls of my room. Another December morning had just begun. I rubbed my eyes, blinked and then, looked at the notorious watch that growled frivolously, telling me that it was 10:00 AM. A tiny journey to a nearby town awaited me. I rushed out with my luggage, walked a fraction of a mile and hired a rickshaw.</p>

<p> The 'rickshaw waala' said he would charge me 60. I bargained, asked him to take 50. Well, that is what I've done a thousand other times. He agreed!</p>
<p>I looked at him, this time a little closely. His ragged vest, probably once white had now weathered. The fibers had absorbed sufficient 'dirt' to look the same. Bundles of thread fell out of innumerable tiny patches of the cloth. Time and sun had possible conspired to bleach his hair white. Eyes sunk deep into their sockets, cheekbones protruding out of the skin which seemed low on fat.</p>
<p>He smiled at me.</p>
<p>"Arey sahib, gaadi nikal jayegi," he said jovially, showing off five of his tobacco tainted teeth. The rest had possibly been knocked off...</p>
<p>He pedaled hard. His perfectly toned triceps rose and fell in succession as he stroked the pedals with his trembling feet. Having ridden for a mile, we came across a narrow stretch of an incline. I looked at the trees and the landscape beyond. It was fascinating. I closed my eyes and felt the breeze striking my face, stroking my hair. It was then that I noticed that we were going at a terribly slow pace. I opened my eyes and locked them at the man who was sweating profusely. He hopped on the pedals, pressing them down with his weight.</p> 
<p>Sometimes, his footwear slipped. On a couple of occasions, he fumbled on the handlebars but his aged body never gave away. I looked at my stuffed luggage. It would’ve weighed a lot. I could’ve walked the stretch on my feet and relieved the old man but the currency in my pocket asked me not to. I quietly obeyed the Indian rupee. "Why else had I paid him?" I said to myself.</p>
<p>“Acha sahib, college jaate ho aap?" He asked me minutes later. The cold wind had somehow washed the pain. He was smiling again.</p>
<p>I nodded. The warm woolen scarf I had wrapped around waved with me, almost in agreement."Mera beta bhi padhta hai. Bohot hoshiyaar hai..."</p><p>"Ek din wo bhi aap jaise college jayega!" The faith in his voice was overwhelmingly strong. I smiled. We talked for a while until I ran out of words.</p>
<p>            At the railway station, I handed him a crisp hundred rupee note. All he could gather in return were three wrinkled, perhaps a decade old ten rupee notes. I wasn't willing to pay more that what I had promised, I had never been. I refused the amount and kept the crisp currency in my custody. He folded his hands, smiled and walked away blessing me. An hour later, I sat at the edge of a seat on the train that would take me home.</p><p>            A man dressed in a black overcoat and similarly colored flannel asked me to produce my tickets. I had none. His protruding belly, overgrown moustache and crisp features claimed that he wanted me to grease his palms. "Acha beta, tum agle coach mein 62 number seat pe baith jao.." </p><p>I obeyed.</br>           Fifteen minutes later I saw the same black lump of mass hovering over me.</p><p>This time I had no escape routes."How much?" I asked him right away. My voice was weak. I felt numb. The train ran past the meadows, wind gushed in and out of the compartments. "100", he grinned.</p><p>            The tickets would've cost me twice of what he demanded. It was after all a worthy bargain. My hands dug deep into my waist pocket. The fine fiber rubbed against my skin. I felt the warmth. In a fine stroke of my wrist, I had pulled out my wallet. I blinked, my reflexes just gave away. I could feel the watch ticking on my wrist, the same watch that had growled at 10:00 AM. I felt everything around me was slowing down.</p><p>            It took me ages to realize that my hands held the same crisp hundred rupee note that the happy old man had returned hours ago.</p>
<p>"I want the penalty and the receipt." I said. I felt the strength in my voice was overpowering. The fear had vanished. The wind that gushed in no longer screamed. The wide grin under the overgrown moustache had vanished. The chubby face now bore a mixture of glum and anger.</p><p>            "You will have to pay twice," he warned.</p><p>I handed him the amount while he signed the receipt. His flesh seemed to have put on weight. He walked away with heavy footsteps stamping the wooden floor.</p><p> </p><p>I took a deep breath, the wind splashed moisture against my face. The winter monsoon had arrived. I wish it would wash away the wrong that men do in their lives.</p><p> </p><p>MEN LIKE YOU AND ME!!</p>
