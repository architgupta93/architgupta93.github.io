        <h2>A Tale of Two Cities</h2>
<p>There are these two cities which I find amusingly contrasting. The irony is that they aren&#8217;t cities at all, they are reflections of life! In my small town with huge mansions, we name them domestic helps ( you might call them whatever you wish to ). I have my own names for them, &#8216;didi&#8217; and &#8216;amma&#8217; ! When I was a couple of months old, Amma had already been an employee for over a couple of years, which makes it roughly 20 years to this date.<br />
Quite a long time to be serving a single family on what I&#8217;d say is a humble pay.</p>
<p>She saw me grow from from an annoying infant to a further more annoying and probably ignorant adolescent. All these years I&#8217;ve seen her work without contempt.
A knock at the door past sunrise meant it was 7. She had arrived.</p>
<p>I am a dumb guy. In my dumber teenage days, I used to sleep like an horse! Quite a few times, she would almost knock the door over in an attempt to wake me up. I would stretch around, these was plenty of work to be done at such odd hour of the day ! And plenty meant walking from my soft, warm quilt to the wooden door that barricaded the howling ( and yes, cold ) winter winds.</p>
<p>A bolt down and a brass knob to be turned around&#8230;<br />
She was there, her toothless grin against the fog. Her hair fell over her wrinkled face. For thirty years, she had been cleaning &#8216;bartan&#8217; and moping the floor with a ragged piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Time had descended well on her. When I looked closely, I could see her numb fingers and the folds in her tanned skin that had absorbed gallons of water over the years. She is an old woman, probably in her 70&#8217;s. Even a kid without a tooth would have felt it. But she doesn&#8217;t care!</p>
<p>That toothless grin just gets broader each day!!</p>
<p>My mother would often make tea for her and boil a little water for the wash. The tiny gulps of warm tea would be interrupted by a strand or two of white hair that slid over to her hollowed cheekbones.</p>
<p>&#8221; When you are a poor man, nothing but your death is secure !&#8221; She is a mother of two strong men! They left home long ago to make a fortune for themselves and their wives. The society would not pay her when she was crippled enough to be incapable of the work she does now, that had never been a deal! We have 2 billion hands to serve us a life soaked in luxury. 2 hands hanging on an empty or satisfied stomach do not really make much of a difference. A needle in the haystack !</p>
<p>But the old woman is happy with her life. She doesn&#8217;t complain, she never does. When it rains, she&#8217;d have her spooky umbrella over her. Summers and winters made no difference either. 7 AM and 3 PM, the clock might miss it, but she never does. When she misses a day, the fat lady living a few blocks up the lane would cut down her pay! She accepts the rest with a smile.
Blown up incisors and rupees don&#8217;t really make much of a difference.</p>
<p>I guess it was yesterday when she said I should be eating yoghurt to beat the heat here at home ! We were sharing a little chat&#8230; Life has perhaps been tough on her, but she looks at me like a kiddo !!!</p>
<p>Any guesses on her pay cheque ?<br />
Half a dozen houses, let me do the math&#8230;<br />
200 hundred utensils dripping oil of the most popular brands, 18000 square feet of floor to be mopped ( roughly the size of a football field ) at a handsome pay of three hundred bucks a piece, making it INR 1800.00 a month ! There is another tale to tell but I think I heard a knock a the door.</p>
<p>Its 03:00 PM !!</p>
