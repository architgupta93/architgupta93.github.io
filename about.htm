                        I am a fifth year PhD  student in the  department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at University  of California, Berkeley.
                        I am current being advised by Prof. David Foster and Prof. Jose Carmena.
                        I am interested in systems neuroscience and its application to building computational devices/systems.
                        Currently, I am working on real-time analysis and manipulation of neural activity to better understand the role of hippocampus in spatial navigation.
                        I am particularly interested in replay and sharp-wave ripples.
                        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04587">Here</a> is a paper introducing some of these concepts, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12112">here</a> is some research from our lab talking about replay and its presumed role in the context of spatial navigation and planning.
                
                <p>
                        I am passionate about biking!
                        In June 2019, I participated in <a href="https://www.aidslifecycle.org/">AIDS LifeCycle</a> which is a 545 mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles to raise money for San Francisco AIDS foundation and the Los Angeles LGBTQ center.
                        In my free time, I like baking sourdough bread and pizzas with a moderate level of success.
