	  	<h3>&nbspINTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p class="introduction">
  			Graphics processing units today provide an enormous amount of computing power for data-parallel scientific applications. However, since these were originally designed to run graphics applications, their fundamental architectural features restrict us from using them for general purpose computing. In order to tap the potential of these units, several hardware/software schemes have been proposed in the past. In this project, we examined the different strategies that are adopted to map a general purpose application onto a GPU. Moreover, we quantified the performance loss that arises from this mapping of general purpose applications onto a GPU in the context of branch divergence. We also looked at qualitative differences in segments of these applications which correspond to the underlying algorithm and the adopted mapping respectively in the context of branch behavior.
