			One of the most commonly encountered problems in computer vision is the extraction of 3D shape of an object from a 2D image. Shape from shading is a technique used to extract the surface gradient by observing the intensity of reflected light. Extraction of shape using stereo vision relies on the relationship between the shift in a pixel and the distance from the viewing plane, when it is viewed from two different positions on the plane. We combined these two orthogonal approaches into a unified one, which  extracts the surface gradient from one of the two frames and uses the pixel shifts to identify the boundary conditions imposed on the 3D structure of the object.
