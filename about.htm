				<p>
					I am a third year PhD  student in the  department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at University  of California, Berkeley.
					I am current being advised by Prof. David Foster and Prof. Jose Carmena.
					I am interested in neuroscience and its application to building computational devices/systems.
				
				<p>
					Academic preferences aside, I am  passionate about music and picked up playing flute a few years ago. 
					Besides, I play drums, keyboard, and guitar in my spare time.
					I used to play hockey as part of my college team at IIT Bombay.
					These days, its just squash, swimming, and biking. I  also like trekking, camping and cooking
