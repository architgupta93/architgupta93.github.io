	<h3>&nbspINTRODUCTION</h3>
	<p class="introduction">
		In a cellular network, Base Stations (BS) are set up to meet the peak Quality of Service (QoS) demands, like throughput, Call Drop Ratio (CDR), coverage etc. of the relevant locality. However, the requirements are not the same throughout the day. Operational costs can be drastically cut down by reorganizing the network dynamically. We developed a model to predict the network state (Voice traffic at each of the BSs) by analytically modeling the traffic data of one of Indiaâ€™s leading telecom operators.

		 Clockwise from left-right. Figure 1 shows the analysis of voice traffic data for a Base Transreceiver Station (BS) of one of india's leading telecom operators over a period of 4 months (The periodicity in data makes it a suitable candidate for prediction). Figure 2 show the partial autocorrelation function of the time series at a particular BS with lags measured in hours. Figure 3 shows the results of our predictions for a period of 5 weekdays. The 97% Confidence limit signifies the region under which the prediction result is expected to remain with 97% probability (This helps in guaranteeing congestion-free behaviour of the network)
