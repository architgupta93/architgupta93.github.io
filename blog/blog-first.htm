		I always had this fancy dream of being a writer one day! Well, life had something different in store for me but every now-and-then, I try writing a few stories about what I see! Hope you like some of them. I'll try to put a few more stories this winter but the ones I could typeset for this blog are the old ones, from 2011 and 2012. Do leave a comment on the Contact page if you like/dislike some of the stories.</br>
