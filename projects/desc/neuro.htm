                <p class="introduction">
			Detailed model for neural behaviour have existed for over half a century. With the advent of Mooreâ€™s law, fabricable memristor devices and extensive study of neural behaviour, it is now possible to design chips that try to immitate the brain. However, to reduce the computational complexity, researchers have developed simplistic models to capture the behaviour of neurons into simple circuits. Models like LIF, AEF etc predominantly model the neuron as an integrator. We present a class of properties that the integrators fail to exhibit but biological plausible and detailed models like Hodgkin-Huxley possess. We then use a Resonate and Fire (RF) model of the neuron, proposed by Izhikevich [2001], which exhbits these properties, to compare its performance with a traditional Integrate and Fire model. We also demonstrate that certain biological phenomenon, involving music, possibly occur because of these traits of a neuron.
