		<h3>MAY - JULY, 2014</h3>
		<p>I worked at the Camera Platform Lab in the Digital Media and Communications, R&D Center at Samsung. Under the guidance of Dr. Dongjin Lee, Senior Engineer, Samsung Electronics, my internship was mainly about designing a System-on-Chip and optimizing it for power consumption. I had to desgin digital controllers for some of the IPs that were being developed in the Lab. RTL design is followed, in order by verification, optimization and synthesis. The aim was to design controllers that would, by architectural difference, consume minimal power. We also evaluated energy complexity of different algorithms by running them on the SoC to propose a solution for power savingsat a higher level of abstraction.     </p>

I got to work with some of the best people involved in industrial design and had a sneak peek at the commercial product in their raw form. The kind of tools, information and processing power that the industries have is simply stunning.

			My internship group was fun, and so were our HR managers. Moreover, South Korea is a great place to visit. Its culture, people and scenic beauty are both unique and soothing. If you get to visit South Korea, don't miss you chance to visit Busan and do not miss on eating Bingsu (Its totally worth it). And if you can live through it, do visit the Jagalchi market. There are a few Buddhist monastries in Korea which are a great experience as well. I've never been more at peace than when I was at one of these.
