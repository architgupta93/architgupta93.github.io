                <p class="introduction">
			As a part of our digital laboratory project, we built a console game using an FPGA, an onboard accelerometer and a VGA monitor. The player has a red block on one end of a maze, and the objective of the game is to make it fall safely through the maze without hitting any of the yellow "mines". Technically, we built a simplified physics engine which could emulatate translational motion on an FPGA, wrote the drivers for the VGA monitor and the accelerometer and did the graphic design for a level.
