	<h2> Objective </h2>	
	<div>
		<p>Technology has grown both in size and reach but the world, at large, is still in need for more of it. I think that research should be directed towards improving the quality of life. As of now, I wish to explore a mixture of neuroscience and computer architecture. There is an entire world of possibilities that we can explore by understanding the workings of our own minds, but it seems that nature is miles ahead. Let's see if we can catch up!</p>

	<p>Especially in a country like India, where everyone can afford to be educated and scope for developement is enormous, we can make a collective effort to change some of the things for good. Most of the problems that we face are unique because of our demographic structure and history. The best solutions for our problems are therefore indegenous ones!</p>
