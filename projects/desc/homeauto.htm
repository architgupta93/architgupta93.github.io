                <p class="introduction">
While a group of friends was working on setting up a central hub to facilitate wireless home automation, I developed an android application for them. You could log in to the application and then add/remove devices to/from your home network and then turn them On/Off from your device. For the demonstration, we added a new lamp to the household and turned it on using the application. It relied mainly on HTML requests and database management to handle the entire process.
