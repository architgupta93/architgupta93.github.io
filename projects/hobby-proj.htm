                <p>
                        As a part of our digital laboratory project, we built a console game using an FPGA, an onboard accelerometer and a VGA monitor. The player has a red block on one end of a maze, and the objective of the game is to make it fall safely through the maze without hitting any of the yellow "mines". Technically, we built a simplified physics engine which could emulatate translational motion on an FPGA, wrote the drivers for the VGA monitor and the accelerometer and did the graphic design for a level.

        <div>
                <p>
			While a group of friends was working on setting up a central hub to facilitate wireless home automation, I developed an android application for them. You could log in to the application and then add/remove devices to/from your home network and then turn them On/Off from your device. For the demonstration, we added a new lamp to the household and turned it on using the application. It relied mainly on HTML requests and database management to handle the entire process.
